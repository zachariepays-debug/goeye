# KNOWN ISSUES

Updated: September 22, 2026

This file tracks active runtime issues only.

For the roadmap and open backlog, see the repository issue tracker.

## Open

### Street traffic can be slow/uneven when panning across dense city blocks
Status: Open (partially mitigated)

Context:
- Current traffic loader fetches one clamped viewport tile at a time (major pass, then full pass).
- In dense cores, some visible roads can appear late after city jumps or fast pans.
- Zooming into adjacent streets does not always immediately trigger higher-detail coverage for all visible roads.

Current mitigation in runtime:
- Fair per-road dot budget allocation (reduces hard starvation under global `MAX_DOTS` cap).
- Center-shift threshold (reduces stale overlap lock while panning).

Next iteration candidates:
- Prioritize currently visible road segments inside the active viewport before off-center segments.
- Add neighbor prefetch ring for nearby tiles after jump-to-city actions.
- Add adaptive dot cap by frame time (coverage first, density second).
- Promote sync chip from loading indicator to true multi-phase progress.

### CCTV panel can appear "missing"
Status: Open (workaround available)

Context:
- The rails lay their panels out themselves. No panel is dragged into place at
  startup and no stored position is read, so a panel that looks missing is
  collapsed or its layer is off rather than parked off-screen. The CCTV panel
  starts collapsed and stays that way until you open it or a camera activates.

Workaround:
- Check that the CCTV layer is enabled in the Layers panel, then open the panel
  from its header control; it also opens on its own when a camera activates.
- To force it open on an ordinary load, store the expanded state and reload. In
  the browser console:
  - `localStorage.setItem('godsEyeView.v6.panelCollapsed.cctv-panel', '0');`
  - `location.reload();`
- Removing that key instead returns the panel to its default, which is collapsed:
  - `localStorage.removeItem('godsEyeView.v6.panelCollapsed.cctv-panel');`
  - `location.reload();`
- Neither console line changes anything when the page was opened from a share
  link: a shared view is laid out from the link, not from what this browser has
  stored, so open the panel from its header control instead.

Related keys (current versions):
- Panel collapsed state: `godsEyeView.v6.panelCollapsed.<panel-id>` — `'0'` open,
  `'1'` closed, absent means the panel's own default. A view opened from a share
  link ignores the stored value entirely.
- Panel positions: `godsEyeView.v8.panelPos.<panel-id>` — the versioned name for a
  stored position. The current layout writes none, so deleting one changes
  nothing.
- CCTV calibration: `godsEyeView.cctv.calibration.v2`

### Height-datum residuals (branch `feat/height-datum`, pending merge)
Status: Open (owner-accepted 2026-07-08, documented)

- **Cold-start floor latency:** at a freshly-visited airport, grounded/low aircraft
  float low for ~1–2 poll cycles (30–60 s) and rise as terrain floors resolve;
  a few stragglers take one more poll.
- **Born-grounded first poll:** a contact first seen on the ground with no altitude
  data renders at the geoid for ≤1 poll until its floor cell warms.
- Full context, improvement ideas, and the verification oracle
  (`scripts/qa-floor-verify.mjs`):
  `docs/superpowers/reports/2026-07-08-height-datum-handover.md`.

### Weather layers: coverage and meaning
Status: Open (source limits, by design)

- **Rain radar covers the contiguous United States only.** It shows MRMS
  reflectivity in dBZ, not rainfall rate or a forecast; a gap in coverage does not
  mean no precipitation.
- **Lightning density is a ground-network grid, not GLM flashes.** It is NOAA's
  15-minute density product derived from Vaisala NLDN/GLD360 on an approximately
  8 km grid, for the Americas and Pacific only (110°E across the dateline to 0°,
  25°S–80°N). It is not a live strike counter or an all-clear.
- **Cyclone advisories cover NOAA's basins only:** the Atlantic and the
  eastern/central North Pacific (NHC and CPHC). Storms elsewhere do not appear.
  The cone is forecast-center uncertainty, not storm size.
- **Satellite clouds:** global infrared is hourly with typically 2–3 hours of
  source latency. Clouds only is a brightness filter, not a cloud mask.
- **Wind is a forecast.** The animation flows through one forecast on an
  approximately 1° grid and does not advance forecast time or follow the
  observed-history timeline.
- **History is not shared.** Share links carry the weather layers and their
  settings but open at Latest.
- **3D Tiles detail window during history playback:** when a frame's detail image
  is slow to arrive, the window may fall back to the coarser full-extent image
  until it does.
- Native hardware GPU behavior of the wind and weather renderers is not yet
  verified.

### Satellite passes and analyst answers
Status: Open (by design)

- Pass predictions search the next 24 hours for satellites in the loaded catalog.
  Visibility is a geometric estimate (satellite sunlit, observer's Sun at or
  below −6°); it ignores weather, satellite brightness and orbital-element age.
- Analyst counts and ranks cover a bounded set of loaded records (by default
  2,000 per layer for satellites, datacenters and dams), so omitted records can
  change a nearest or count answer. Satellite distance is ground distance.

---

### Live camera video (HLS)
Status: Open (limits)

- At most two live-video sessions run at once. RTMP-only sources and encrypted,
  fMP4 or byte-range playlists are not supported.
- When live video fails, the camera falls back to its labeled still, Street View
  or placeholder frame, which is not live video.

## Closed / Intentional (for clarity)

### Proxy SSRF and error-surface hardening gaps
Status: Closed as fixed on `main`

Context:
- Proxy middleware previously allowed broader error/internal surface area and looser upstream handling.
- Current `main` includes hardened proxy behavior in `vite.config.js`:
  - CCTV upstream URL no longer accepted from client query params.
  - Error payloads are sanitized.
  - OpenSky cache stores successful responses only.
  - OpenSky token refresh is coalesced.
  - GBFS/CCTV memory growth is bounded.

Validation target:
- `vite.config.js`

---

### NVG vignette edge color bleed
Status: Closed as fixed in current shader composite

Context:
- Earlier builds leaked original scene colors near the NVG tube edge.
- Current composite now masks NVG output with tube falloff before final blend, removing the color edge bleed.

Validation target:
- `src/styles/surveillance.js`

---

### Wildfires layer unavailable / static bundled snapshot
Status: Closed — live FIRMS integration shipped (2026-07-16)

Context:
- Wildfires (NASA FIRMS) were removed from runtime in v0.5.3, returned June 2026 as a
  bundled-snapshot layer (`local-firms`, 2026-05-25 data, ~58 MB in-repo), and were
  converted to **live NASA FIRMS data** on 2026-07-16: the `/api/firms` proxy merges
  three VIIRS NRT sources (trailing 24 h, 30 min cache, serve-stale-on-failure) and the
  bundled snapshot was deleted. Requires a free server-side `FIRMS_MAP_KEY`; without it
  the layer row reads "Needs FIRMS_MAP_KEY — add it in Provider Settings".

---

### Weather radar held out of the open-source release
Status: Closed — observed rain radar shipped (September 2026)

Context:
- Rain radar, Satellite clouds, Lightning density, Wind and Cyclone advisories
  are in the Weather group of Data Layers. Their current limits are listed under
  "Weather layers: coverage and meaning" above.
