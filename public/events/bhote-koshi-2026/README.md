For commercial use, obtain separate permission or exclude both this pack and the
derived coordinate dataset in `src/data/bhoteKoshiFloodPath.js` from the source
and build. Deleting this directory alone does not remove the compiled river
data. Excluding the Nepal scene also requires removing its registrations and
imports before building, including the `get_bhote_koshi_flood` tool in
`src/tools/queries/events.js`.

Witness clips and cached posters are not bundled. Cards link to the original
source, or use the original platform's embed where available. An unavailable
embed leaves the source link accessible. Capture times remain unverified.

Esri basemap imagery and runtime terrain are fetched separately, not bundled;
their provider attribution remains visible in the application.

The Nepal sequence supports both keyed and keyless map setups. Google 3D is used
for authored 3D shots when available; otherwise those shots use Esri imagery.
Without a Cesium ion token, terrain comes from Re:Earth / Mapterhorn. With an
ion token, the configured Cesium terrain remains available. Vantor comparison
shots use Esri in either mode. Provider resolution does not rewrite saved shots.

## Interpretation limits

The 2021 image is historical context, not an immediate pre-event baseline.
Differences also span development, seasons, sensors, and the July 2025
Rasuwagadhi flood. The amber corridor is a schematic progression along the
published river centerline, not modeled arrival time. Its width and timing
must not be used for emergency planning, exposure analysis, or casualty claims.

Evidence cards identify observations outside the Vantor comparison rectangle.
The Rasuwagadhi witness focus uses the 2021 context image because the 2026
scene does not provide useful coverage at that point. The Timure record groups
five source-map placements, not five independent timing confirmations.
