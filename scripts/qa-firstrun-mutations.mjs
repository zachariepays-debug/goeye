/**
 * Are the first-run launcher's pins actually load-bearing?
 *
 * A pin that only goes red when you delete the whole feature proves very little.
 * This reverts each decision INDIVIDUALLY — the smallest edit that reintroduces
 * the original defect or contradicts the owner's ruling — and requires
 * src/firstRunExperience.test.mjs to go red for it. Every entry names what it
 * restores, so the count is reproducible rather than asserted in a commit
 * message.
 *
 *   node scripts/qa-firstrun-mutations.mjs
 *
 * Every touched file is restored on exit, including on failure.
 *
 * NOTE: two mutations edit the server voice tools/instructions, and a running dev server watches those
 * files and restarts on every write. Writes are therefore content-guarded below
 * so the file is touched exactly twice per mutation instead of on every
 * iteration — enough that a dev server survives, but expect it to restart. If
 * you are mid-QA on a live server, run this before or after, not during.
