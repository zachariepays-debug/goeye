 * Are the floor-hold pins actually load-bearing?

 * A pin that is red only when you delete the whole feature proves very little.
 * This reverts each fix INDIVIDUALLY — the smallest edit that reintroduces the
 * original defect — and requires the floor suites to go red for it. Every entry
 * names the defect it restores, so the count is reproducible rather than
 * asserted in a commit message.
