/**
 * qa-perf — render-governor regression gate (perf wave 2).
 *
 * Asserts the governor's observable contract with RELATIVE frame-count
 * assertions (SwiftShader-safe; no wall-clock GPU numbers):
 *
 *  1. Idle + zero layers + parked camera → the scene stops rendering
 *     (near-zero postRender fires over a settle-then-observe window).
 *  2. A discrete mutation while idle (style slider write routed through
 *     governorRequestRender) → at least one render, then settles again.
 *  3. Camera movement while idle → renders happen (Cesium-native path).
 *  4. Flights enabled → continuous mode (postRender cadence ≈ rAF cadence,
 *     and ≥5× the idle count over the same window).
 *  5. Flights disabled again → back to idle (near-zero fires).
 *  6. Governor diagnostics agree with the mode at every step.
 *
 * ── WHAT THE IDLE WINDOWS MEASURE, AND WHY THEY WAIT ────────────────────────
 *
 * The idle checks (1 and 5) measure the STEADY-STATE floor: what a parked scene
 * costs once it has settled. They do not measure how long settling takes, so the
 * counted window has to begin AFTER settling — and "after" is a stronger
 * condition than "nothing is happening right now".
 *
 * That distinction became load-bearing when detection stopped holding the render
 * loop open (2026-08-22) and became a default. With a paint lane active, the
 * world-overlay host honours its occluder observers with frames: chrome that
 * changes SIZE resizes an occluder, `markLayoutDirty` fires, and that becomes a
 * `requestRender`. While detection forced continuous mode this was invisible.
 * Event-driven, it shows up as renders.
 *
 * The specific contaminant, pinned with stack traces on this tree, is triggered
 * by THIS HARNESS'S OWN SETUP. Disabling every layer publishes a `visibility`
 * change; the HUD subscribes to that and marks its semantic summary dirty
 * (`src/hud.js`), and the summary refreshes on a 15-SECOND interval
 * (`HUD_SUMMARY_INTERVAL_MS`). So up to 15 s after the teardown a tick fetches a
 * new summary and TYPES it in with a typewriter animation; the growing text
 * reflows `.hud-corner.hud-top-left`, an occluder, and the host turns that
 * reflow into a handful of frames. Two instrumented runs (150 s and 180 s
 * watches) agree to the second: the teardown lands at 15 s, the burst at 31 s —
 * seven frames in that one second — which is 16 s after the teardown and 4 s
 * INTO the window the old settle had already started counting. Neither run then
 * saw a single further render, across 146 s and 176 s respectively. It is a
 * one-shot: the tick that fetches also clears the summary's dirty flag and
 * commits its context signature, so every later tick returns early.
 *
 * Waiting for "an empty second" cannot survive that, because the scene really IS
 * empty for the ~15 s between the teardown and the tick that notices it. So the
 * settle below requires a quiet RUN LONGER THAN ONE FULL SUMMARY TICK, and that
 * run resets on any activity. Quiet then means something stronger and checkable:
 * a complete refresh period has elapsed in which the app looked at its new state
 * and found nothing to do. The length is derived from the app's own cadence
 * rather than tuned against a flake rate — if that interval changes, this moves
 * with it.
 *
 * The threshold inside the window (≤4 fires / 5 s) is untouched. The teeth live
 * in the WAIT, not the threshold: a scene rendering every frame never produces an
 * empty second at all, so the bounded wait expires and FAILS. Quiet that never
 * arrives IS the failure, which is why the timeout is an assertion rather than a
 * fall-through — and it is what keeps this honest if the churn ever stops being a
 * one-shot. It would: when `/api/openai/hud-summary` is unreachable the summary
 * stays dirty and re-types every 15 s, so that machine gets a loud repeatable
 * failure here rather than a coin flip.
 *
 * The underlying fix belongs to the host, not to this harness: an active lane
 * with nothing to place is not paint work and should not be honoured with a
 * frame. That is worldOverlay surgery — see the post-launch ledger entry
 * "world-overlay honours occluder churn as paint work" in
 * the project roadmap.
 *
 * Usage: node scripts/qa-perf.mjs [--url http://localhost:4173]
 * Requires a running dev server. Headless; flags disable occlusion
 * throttling so rAF cadence is trustworthy (hidden-pane gotcha).
