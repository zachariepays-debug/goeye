// src/contactsDetectionPolicy.js — Contacts-scoped detection policy.
//
// Owner playtest 2026-08-18: "when you click on Contacts, detections should just
// turn on, and they should stay on in Cockpit or in third-person tracking inside
// Contacts or inside Cockpit, both… when I leave the Cockpit, detections go off"
// — that last part being the bug.
//
// The scope is CONTACTS, not Cockpit. Three rules follow:
//
//  1. ACTIVATING Contacts turns detection on at the tactical preset the military
//     styles use. The session-wide `_detectionUserOverridden` flag gates the map
//     STYLE presets only (an explicit Sparse/Off must survive a style switch)
//     and is deliberately NOT consulted here — Contacts is a mode you enter, not
//     a preset that fires behind your back.
//  2. Detection then STAYS on for the whole Contacts session. Cockpit enter and
//     exit, and third-person tracking, do not touch it at all — they are moves
//     WITHIN Contacts, and an earlier build that captured/restored around
//     cockpit is exactly what turned detections off on cockpit exit.
//  3. Whatever the operator does next INSIDE the session stands. Detection is
//     never re-forced while Contacts stays active, so a manual DETECT-off holds
//     until the next activation.
//
// Deactivating Contacts restores the pre-Contacts state, mirroring the
// established `_cockpitVisionRestore` pattern in ui.js: a mode's look is scoped
// to that mode and never leaks out.

/**
