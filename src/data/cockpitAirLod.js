/**
 * Derive the AIR-contact near band for Cockpit presentation.
 *
 * This state is deliberately independent from 3D model admission. A contact
 * inside the band stays an aircraft silhouette even when 3D is off, its model
 * is still loading, or the model budget is full. Contacts outside the band are
 * compact dots. Retained contacts use the wider KEEP radius so crossing the
 * ADD boundary cannot make the visual oscillate.
 *
 * @param {Set<string>} previousIds - Contacts retained by the prior update.
 * @param {Iterable<[string, number]>} distancesSquared - Contact id and squared distance in metres.
 * @param {number} addDistanceM - Radius for contacts entering the near band.
 * @param {number} keepDistanceM - Radius for contacts already in the near band.
 * @returns {Set<string>} The next near-contact set.
