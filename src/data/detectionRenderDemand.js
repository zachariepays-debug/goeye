/**
 * Detection's render demand — when the overlay actually needs another frame.
 *
 * Detection used to take an unconditional continuous-render hold for as long as
 * it was on (`holdContinuousRender('detection')`). That was honest when it was
 * written: the overlay repainted from scratch every frame, so "on" really did
 * mean "per-frame work". It stopped being honest once the world-overlay host
 * became demand-driven — `invalidateHost()` already requests a frame on every
 * content change, and Cesium's `requestRenderMode` already renders on camera
 * input and tile loads, so a parked scene with detection on was paying 60 fps
 * for pixels that do not change.
 *
 * Nobody noticed because detection was OFF by default. Turning it ON by default
 * (2026-08-22) would have shipped that hot loop to every idle first-run tab —
 * defeating the render governor, whose whole reason for existing is the ~60% GPU
 * and ~54% of a core a parked scene used to burn (`src/renderGovernor.js`).
 *
 * So detection no longer holds. It is driven the way the rest of the host is:
 * repaint on CHANGE, and — for work that spans frames — ask for exactly one more
 * frame while that work is outstanding. That is the pattern `drawWorldOverlay`
 * already uses for its own fades, and the same shape as the earthquake-disc fix
 * (static geometry, hold removed) that this follows.
 *
 * ── THE ONE RULE ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Every input below must be able to reach a state where it stops asking. A
 * predicate that can stay true forever is the old hold under another name, and
 * that is the property the unit pins defend hardest.
 *
 * Three kinds of outstanding work qualify, and each terminates:
 *
 *   1. the fade-in when detection (re)activates — a bounded window;
 *   2. label fades, IN as well as out — the arbiter drives every one of them to
 *      a settled alpha;
 *   3. a label solve the frame could not run — the throttle defers it by at most
 *      one interval, a skipped paint by exactly one frame.
 *
 * (2) said "out" only, once. A newly selected label fading IN is `selected`, so
 * counting the fade-OUT tail missed it entirely: on a parked scene a label could
 * be selected and then never painted past its first frame — invisible until some
 * unrelated frame happened along. Fade-in and fade-out are the same animation
 * seen from two ends, with the same termination. Both count.
 *
 * ── ONE CLOCK ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The timestamp is the host frame's own `frame.timestamp` — `performance.now()`,
 * sampled ONCE per frame by `drawWorldOverlay` — and the SAME value must reach
 * both the paint and this policy.
 *
 * Two samples of a clock taken a millisecond apart inside one frame is a real
 * defect, not pedantry: paint at age 219 ms draws alpha 0.99545, and a policy
 * re-sampling at 220 ms answers "done", so the frame that would have painted the
 * settled alpha is never requested and the fade visibly stops a hair short.
 * Sharing one timestamp makes the frame that paints final state the same frame
 * that ends demand, by construction. Monotonicity removes the other half of that
 * defect: a wall clock can jump backwards and leave an elapsed-time test true
 * until it catches up, which is exactly the "asks forever" failure this module
 * exists to prevent.
 *
 * Pure functions + constants so the policy is unit-testable without a viewer or
 * a canvas; detection.js owns the plumbing.
