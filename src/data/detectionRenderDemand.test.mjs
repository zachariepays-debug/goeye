//
// Detection must not hold the render loop open — and must not drop work on the
// floor once it stops holding.
//
// It used to take an unconditional continuous-render hold for as long as it was
// on. That was invisible while detection defaulted OFF; turning it ON by default
// (2026-08-22) would have shipped a permanent 60 fps loop to every idle
// first-run tab, defeating the render governor whose entire purpose is that a
// parked scene costs nothing.
//
// Removing a hold moves the burden of proof. Under the hold a frame was always
// coming, so anything could be deferred for free; without it, the frame a piece
// of work was given may be the ONLY one, and whatever consumes that frame
// without finishing the work strands it indefinitely. The first cut of this
// module stranded four different things — a review reproduced all four live on a
// parked scene — so these pins are organized around that failure mode:
//
//   1. POLICY — what counts as outstanding work, and that every kind of it can
//      reach a state where it stops asking. A predicate that can stay true
//      forever is the old hold under another name.
//   2. ANIMATION accounting — fade-IN counts, not only the fade-out tail. A
//      newly selected label is `selected`, so counting only unselected rows left
//      it invisible on a parked scene until some unrelated frame arrived.
//   3. ONE CLOCK — paint and demand read the same per-frame timestamp, so the
//      frame that paints an animation's final state is the frame that ends its
//      demand, and a non-monotonic clock cannot make demand permanent.
//   4. WIRING — the hold is really gone; a skipped paint re-requests instead of
//      swallowing; a layer whose contents changed dirties the solve.
//
// The runtime counterpart — parked scene, detection ON vs OFF, near-zero renders
// either way, and the overlay still painting — is `scripts/qa-perf.mjs` §1b.

// continuous-render hold for their own per-frame fleet animation. So for exactly
// as long as there is anything to bracket, the scene is rendering every frame
// and the overlay repaints with it. (Measured live 2026-08-23 on a parked
// camera: an outside-aircraft population change moved the painted bracket count
// with no camera input, holds = ["flights"], requestRenderMode = false.)

// That is a COUPLING, so it deserves a pin. If a later perf pass strips these
