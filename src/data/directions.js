/**
 * @module directions
 * @description Service bundle for the Directions layer.
 *
 * The layer itself lives in `src/layers/directions/`, which imports nothing
 * but Cesium and the pure step formatter. This module is the one place that
 * names the application's shared services — the render governor, sprite order,
 * the pick registry, the world overlay, the annotation material, the camera
 * verbs, the shared ground floor and the pointer arbiter — and it re-exports
 * the layer's pure helpers for the tests and the share-link code.
