 *
 * THE ORIENTATION PROBLEM (2026-06-10 playtest): billboards are camera-facing
 * quads, so "point along the real-world course" must be computed in SCREEN
 * space. The previous approach mixed two regimes (surface-normal alignedAxis
 * at oblique pitch, camera-heading compensation at nadir) and broke in
 * tracked-entity orbit mode, where camera.heading is expressed in the
 * entity's reference frame — the tracked icon stayed glued to the viewport.
 *
 * THE FIX: transform the local course vector into world space, then project it
 * directly onto the camera's right/up basis. This stays valid when a forward
 * probe point would be off-screen or behind the camera during a >180° tracked
 * orbit. The camera-basis projection is exact at the viewport center and an
 * intentional orthographic approximation elsewhere: an off-center contact at
 * oblique pitch can diverge from a pinhole/window-space projection because the
 * latter also includes the course vector's depth component. The approximation
 * keeps rotation continuous through tracked orbits; field evidence, not an
 * unverified math swap, decides whether exact projection becomes preferred.

 *
 * THERE ARE TWO REGIMES AND THEY ANSWER DIFFERENT QUESTIONS. Read this before
 * trusting the number for anything other than a plate alpha.
 *
 * ABOVE the ellipsoid the horizon is the tangent silhouette and the test is a
 * genuine ray/ellipsoid hit test: 1 means the view ray through the point misses
 * the planet entirely. Here the function is the exact complement of
 * {@link horizonOccluder} — the occluder asks whether the planet is in FRONT of
 * a point (cull it), this asks whether it is BEHIND (what a screen-space label
 * anchored there is read against). For any point the occluder keeps, a ray that
 * hits the ellipsoid must hit it beyond the point, so the hit/miss test alone
 * settles the backdrop.
 *
 * AT OR BELOW the ellipsoid there is no tangent cone, and the test is NOT a ray
 * hit test. It is an EYE-PLANE convention: 1 means the point sits above the
 * camera's local geodetic horizontal. The two genuinely differ — from a camera
 * 18 m under the surface, the ray to a contact 900 m up and a few km out
 * CROSSES the ellipsoid on the way there, and the answer is still sky. That is
 * deliberate. A sub-ellipsoid camera is an artifact of the geoid/ellipsoid
 * split, not of being underground: the geoid runs ~34 m below the ellipsoid at
 * JFK, so a cockpit parked on the ramp there sits at −18 m of ellipsoid height
 * with the whole rendered world still above it. The ellipsoid that ray crosses
 * is not a surface anyone can see, so intersecting it would answer a question
 * nobody asked; what a label is read against is decided instead by whether it
 * sits above or below the viewer's eye level. Cesium's `EllipsoidalOccluder`
 * takes the same convention below the surface, so the two stay sign-consistent
 * — the complementarity above survives as agreement here.
 *
 * The regimes MEET rather than being switched between: the horizon dip
 * acos(R/(R+h)) falls to zero as the camera settles onto the surface, so the
 * tangent cone opens continuously to the horizontal plane, and clamping the
 * cone's sine at 1 (half-angle 90°) IS that limit — not a special case.
 *
 * Computed in scaled space, where WGS84 becomes a unit sphere. That map is
 * affine, so both regimes stay exact: above the surface ray-surface
 * intersection is preserved and the zero crossing is the true silhouette rather
 * than a spherical stand-in; below it the eye plane is the true GEODETIC
 * tangent plane, because the scaled radial maps back to (x/a², y/a², z/b²), the
 * real surface normal, which at 40°N sits 0.19° off the geocentric radial. Only
 * the magnitude of the margin picks up the flattening, and a feather band does
 * not care about a third of a percent.
 *
 * Deliberately geometric, not photometric, in BOTH regimes: sampling rendered
 * pixels behind every label would be correct about mountains and towers that
 * rise above the horizon, and would also cost a readback per label per frame.
 * The band absorbs that approximation — a contact just above the horizon lands
 * mid-blend, which is the honest answer when the backdrop is part sky.
