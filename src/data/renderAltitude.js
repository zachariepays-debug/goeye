// src/data/renderAltitude.js — pure priority-chain helper for aircraft render
// altitude (docs/plans/2026-07-05-entity-height-datum-fix.md Task 6).
//
// The globe needs ELLIPSOIDAL height (h = H + N). OpenSky's `geo_altitude`
// (state-vector index 13) is already WGS84 geometric/ellipsoidal — the
// correct value to hand `Cartesian3.fromDegrees(lon, lat, h)` verbatim.
// `baro_altitude` (index 7) is barometric/MSL-referenced (and, unlike a true
// GPS-derived geo_altitude, also carries non-standard-pressure QNH error) —
// it is only a VISUAL FALLBACK when geo_altitude is missing, corrected by
// adding the local geoid undulation N (src/data/geoid.js) so it at least
// lands close to the ellipsoid instead of sinking into high-elevation
// terrain. This module makes NO claim that baro+N is geometrically exact.
//
// Kept as a small standalone module (rather than inlined in flights.js) so
// it can be unit-tested in isolation and reused verbatim by the military
// flights layer (Task 7).

 * @param {boolean} params.onGround - OpenSky on_ground flag.
