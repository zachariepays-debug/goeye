/**
 * @file One-shot loader that caches success and rate-limits failure.
 *
 * The bundled data packs (Natural Earth regions, neighborhood polygons) are
 * loaded once per session and memoized. Memoizing the *promise* is the cheap
 * way to do that, but it silently turns one transient failure into a
 * session-long outage: every later call re-returns the same rejection, and
 * the callers — which `.catch(() => null)` — report it to the user as "no
 * such region" rather than "the data pack didn't load".
 *
 * This keeps the memoization and drops it on rejection, so a later caller
 * retries. Retries are NOT immediate: a voice/analyst caller in a loop would
 * otherwise hammer a permanently broken pack once per spoken query. A failed
 * loader serves its recorded rejection until a cooldown elapses, doubling per
 * consecutive failure up to a ceiling. Concurrent callers share one in-flight
 * load; success is cached permanently.
 *
