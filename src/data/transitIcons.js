 * Front-up transit-vehicle silhouettes, one per mode, as SVG data URIs for
 * Cesium billboards.
 *
 * Same house language as `aircraftIcons.js`: a 96-unit viewBox with the glyph
 * centred at (48,48), drawn nose toward -Y so the screen-projected rotation in
 * `iconOrientation.js` can spin the whole glyph, filled WHITE with a dark
 * hairline edge so the tint pipeline (billboard.color = the mode colour, plus
 * `.withAlpha` fades) keeps working. No glyph carries a colour of its own; a
 * hardcoded fill would fight the tint that tells a person what they are looking
 * at.
 *
 * These are plan views, the way a vehicle reads from a camera above a street —
 * not side elevations. Each mode has a DISTINCT outline so it is recognisable
 * at the ~18 px the fleet renders at, by shape and not only by colour: a bus is
 * short and blunt, a tram is long and slender with articulation joints, a metro
 * car is squared off, a mainline train has a tapered nose, and a ferry is a
 * hull with a bow.
 *
 * Interior detail is drawn with the same dark hairline as the edge — windscreen
 * lines, articulation joints, a deck line — because a solid dark panel would
 * darken the tint and a white-on-white panel would vanish.
