    //
    // `enabling` and the never-answered predicate cover two DIFFERENT windows, and
    // both are needed because these dependencies do not settle the same way.
    //
    //   - military-installations is covered by `enabling` alone. Its enable() is
    //     SYNCHRONOUS and the manager awaits update(), which owns the first
    //     Overpass fetch, so the lifecycle stays `enabling` for that whole window
    //     however long the fetch takes. Confirmed live: a held 17 s first fetch
    //     read `enabling` across 34 samples with the panel non-numeric throughout,
    //     and a failing one settled to `enabled` with status 'unavailable'. Its
    //     getStats() also reports loading while a request is in progress —
    //     setInstallationStatus is only ever called with
    //     loading/zoom-in/ready/stale/empty/unavailable.
    //   - ais-live-vessels is what the predicate below is FOR. Its enable() and
    //     update() both resolve as soon as the first /api/vessels poll answers,
    //     so the lifecycle settles to `enabled` — but until the server-side socket
    //     delivers a position, firstConnectPhase is 'loading' and getStats()
    //     reports loading: true, lastUpdate: null, count 0, and an UNDEFINED
    //     status. That zero is an absence of evidence, not evidence of absence,
    //     and neither the lifecycle nor the status list can tell.
    //
    // Deliberately `loading === true` and not truthiness: layers that never report
    // a busy flag (flights, military) must keep answering for themselves, and a
    // source that HAS answered once (lastUpdate set) keeps its last real count
    // through every later poll rather than blanking to `?` on each refresh.
