// src/data/fireAnchors.js — DEM ground anchors for rendered FIRMS detections
// (owner field finding 2026-07-21: at close/oblique zoom over high country,
// fire dots anchored at ellipsoid height 0 read as buried inside the terrain
// ~1-2 km below the visible surface).
//
// The fix rides the height-datum ship's machinery end to end: anchors read
// the SAME shared ground floor every other ground-adjacent consumer uses
// (groundFloor.cachedGroundFloor — rendered-mesh cell ?? real Re:Earth DEM
// cell), and cold cells warm through the same batched, chunked, cached
// resolver. No 3D-Tiles sampling happens here (zero steady-state raycasts);
// fires are static, and floor cells latch warm for the session, so each
// rendered detection costs at most one DEM lookup EVER — and detections
// sharing a ~111 m coarse cell share that lookup.
