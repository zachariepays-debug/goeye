/**
 * @module militaryFlights
 * @description Real-time military flight tracking layer powered by the adsb.lol API.
 *
 * Renders aircraft as amber chevron billboards in a single BillboardCollection
 * for GPU-efficient batch drawing. Supports click-to-track: selecting an aircraft
 * spawns an Entity the camera follows, whose position is driven by a
 * dead-reckoning CallbackProperty. The whole fleet renders at
 * now - RENDER_DELAY_SEC so positions interpolate BETWEEN two known fixes
 * instead of extrapolating ahead and snapping back when the next poll lands.
 *
 * Billboard orientation uses alignedAxis set to the WGS84 surface normal at each
 * position so that the rotation angle (heading/track) operates in the local tangent
 * plane where 0 deg = north; near nadir the icons switch to screen-aligned
 * rotation (camera.heading - track) with hysteresis.

// ground snap (see _modelDisplayPosition).
