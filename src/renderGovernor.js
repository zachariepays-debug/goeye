/**
 * Idle render governor — the wave-2 flagship of the 2026-08-05 perf
 * investigation.
 *
 * The problem: Cesium's default render loop repaints every vsync forever, so
 * the app burned ~60% GPU + ~54% of a core with ZERO layers enabled and a
 * parked camera. The fix: flip the scene into Cesium's `requestRenderMode`
 * whenever nothing animates per frame, and return to the continuous loop the
 * moment something does.
 *
 * Architecture — a binary mode driven by ref-counted holds:
 *
 * - **Continuous mode** (`requestRenderMode = false`, today's behavior)
 *   while ANY hold is registered. Every per-frame animator — fleet
 *   interpolation, traffic sim, satellite motion, tracked-entity follow,
 *   style crossfades, CCTV projection — registers a hold for exactly the
 *   lifetime of its scene-loop listener or animation. While one is active,
 *   behavior is byte-identical to pre-governor main: the locked
 *   interpolation/tracking invariants are preserved by construction.
 * - **Idle mode** (`requestRenderMode = true`) when zero holds. Cesium
 *   auto-renders on camera input and tile loads; every other scene mutation
 *   must call `governorRequestRender()` for its one frame. Discrete
 *   mutators (layer poll ticks, slider writes, annotation changes) route
 *   through that.
 *
 * Holds are identity-keyed (a Set of owner ids), NOT a counter — a module
 * that double-holds or double-releases cannot corrupt the mode. Owners are
 * short stable strings ('flights', 'traffic', 'style-anim', …) so the
 * diagnostics read like a story.
 *
 * The governor is O(1) passive: no per-frame work of its own, ever.
