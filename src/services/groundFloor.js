  //  - RS46 (military H60): baro-only low-altitude contacts near steep terrain
  //    render INSIDE the hillside (no alt_geom → baro+N is off by more than the
  //    local relief).
  //  - WAKE01 (military B212): trail waypoints flagged 'ground' rendered at a
  //    fixed 50 m ellipsoidal sentinel — ~1.5 km underground at Kirtland AFB
  //    (field elevation ~1590 m ellipsoidal).
  //
  // The fix everywhere is the same: never render below the local ellipsoidal
  // surface. This module provides the shared floor: a COARSE (3-decimal,
  // ~111 m) grid over Task 3's terrainHeights resolver/cache, so that moving
  // aircraft and multi-hundred-point trails collapse onto a small set of cells
  // with heavy cache reuse (the exact 5-decimal grid would mint a new cache key
  // every fix — the taxiing-cache lesson from the adversarial review).
  // A ~111 m cell means the floor can be off by the relief within the cell in
  // steep terrain; the clamp is a visual floor, not a survey — lifting an icon
  // a few metres short of a ridge line still beats burying it.
  //
  // Zero-network on the render path: reads are synchronous cache lookups;
  // `warmGroundFloor` batches the misses through resolveEllipsoidalGround
  // (single-flight, fire-and-forget) exactly like flights.js's grounded-surface
  // warm — results land for later polls/appends.

   *    floor under the contact simply does not lift it — the same "no clamp" the
   *    cold-cell case already has, bounded by one cell of grade (metres).
   *  - Too HIGH actively invents a position. It is bounded by BUILDING HEIGHT,
   *    not by grade, and a parked contact holds it: measured on the A/B rig,
   *    a lone roof neighbour put a contact 29.5 m up and left it there
   *    permanently when its own cell never warmed, and 6.3 s of visible
   *    stair-stepping when it did.
   * A plane at a gate is on the apron, never on the terminal roof, so on a
   * structure edge the LOW neighbour is the answer and the high one is an
   * artefact of the photogrammetric mesh.
   *
   * The honest residual: on a genuine SLOPE the lowest neighbour under-reads by
   * the grade across ~111 m, so the clamp lifts a little less than it could. That

   *  2. Candidates are ordered by how many of their cells are genuinely cold,
   *     then by speed (whoever leaves their floor behind soonest).
   *  3. Allocation runs in widening rounds — one cell each, then `fairShare`
   *     each, then the remainder — so no contact is left with NOTHING while
   *     another takes seconds. The nearest cell is the one a contact needs first
   *     anyway; the far end of its corridor can wait a poll.

   * Ranking alone still starves a TIE longer than the budget: 80 equally needy
   * movers means the same stable prefix wins every poll and the tail never moves.
   * The `epoch` rotates each run of equal-ranked candidates, so a tie cycles
   * round-robin across polls while a genuinely needier contact is never demoted
   * below a less needy one (rotation happens WITHIN a rank, never across ranks).
   *
   * `seen` alone is NOT a sufficient free-list: in production it holds only the
   * CURRENT poll's batch, so a cell that warmed on an earlier poll looked new and
   * spent budget again, letting a contact's near cells consume its whole share
   * poll after poll while the ground ahead of it stayed cold. Budget is therefore
   * charged only for cells with no floor yet (`isWarm`) — but warm cells are
   * still EMITTED, because the mesh sampler must see a cell again after its DEM
   * prior lands or it never latches a rendered-surface height there.
   *
   * That gives a service bound derivable from the policy rather than a magic
   * number: the first round charges at most one cell per candidate, so at least
   * `min(candidates, budget)` candidates are served per poll; a candidate that
   * misses out keeps its cold count while every served candidate's drops, so it
   * outranks them next poll. Every candidate is therefore served within
