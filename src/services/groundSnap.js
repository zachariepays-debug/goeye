/**
 * groundSnap.js — one-shot cached ground-height snap for MODELED grounded aircraft.
 *
 * Why: a parked/taxiing plane's feed altitude is last-known baro or 0 m — nowhere
 * near the photoreal tile skin in ellipsoid heights (buried ~100+ m at inland
 * airports like AUS, floating ~30 m at sea-level fields like SFO, where the geoid
 * sits below the ellipsoid). A 3D model placed at the meta altitude therefore
 * renders inside the tiles or hovering above them. Billboards dodge this with
 * disableDepthTestDistance; a depth-tested glTF model cannot.
 *
 * Discipline (CCTV-B9b style): scene.sampleHeight forces a synchronous offscreen
 * pick render, so it is NEVER called per frame. Each grounded modeled plane gets
 * ONE successful sample, cached per icao; the cache stops answering directly when
 * the plane moves >MOVE_INVALIDATE_M from the sampled spot (taxiing). Misses (tiles
 * still streaming, OSM fallback with no tileset skin, sample outside loaded
 * geometry) are a retry-later signal with per-icao exponential backoff. A
 * per-window budget stops a freshly modeled airport cluster from firing dozens of
 * pick renders in one fleet tick.
 *
 * What a caller gets while a sample is outstanding depends on whether this
 * contact has ever HAD one, and the difference is the difference between two
 * kinds of wrong:
 *  - COLD (nothing ever resolved here) — null. There is no evidence of where the
 *    ground is, and the only honest answer for a depth-tested model is not to
 *    place it at all; the caller keeps the depth-test-free billboard.
 *  - WARM (a snap resolved, then taxi invalidated it and the resample has not
 *    landed) — the last measurement, held within HELD_SNAP_MAX_DRIFT_M. Hiding
 *    the model here would pop a taxiing aircraft from 3D back to 2D for a whole
 *    retry backoff, and the ground it was measured on a few dozen metres back is
 *    real evidence, not a guess. Same shape as the billboard chain's
 *    `_heldDisplayFloorM` (flights.js): hold the last thing that resolved,
 *    bounded by how far the contact can have travelled from it.
 *
 * A hold is a MEMORY, and it is ranked accordingly: held evidence never outranks
 * fresh evidence that contradicts it. Distance travelled is only a proxy for
 * "does this still describe the ground here", and it is a loose one — a contact
 * can taxi 200 m onto a different surface well inside the bound, and because a
 * miss preserves the hold, nothing in the retry path would ever correct that.
 * So where the mesh-floor cells have actually MEASURED the surface under the
 * contact's current position, and that surface is ABOVE the held value by more
 * than HELD_SNAP_CONTRADICTION_M, the measurement wins: the hold is dropped and
 * the contact is COLD again. The fallback is the floored 2D billboard, which is
 * the honest picture — a model buried in the apron is not a better one.
 *
 * Shared by flights.js and militaryFlights.js (one instance each — the caches
 * are per-layer, keyed by that layer's icao space).

/** @constant {number} How far a contact may travel from the spot its snap was
 *  measured at before that measurement stops describing the ground under it, and
 *  the hold is dropped rather than stretched.
 *
 *  Sized to two things at once. It has to outlast a resample outage, or it buys
 *  nothing: RETRY_MAX_MS is 30 s of backoff, and ordinary taxi is ~10 m/s, so a
 *  hold that expires inside ~25 s of rolling would hand back the pop it exists to
 *  prevent. And it has to stay inside the grade error an airfield can hide: the
 *  KAUS spread this file's header cites is ~21 m across a ~4 km field, ~0.5%, so
 *  250 m of taxi is ~1.3 m of vertical error — the order of the belly offsets
 *  already being added, and two orders under the ~100+ m burial the snap exists
 *  to prevent.
 *
 *  Deliberately a quarter of the billboard chain's HELD_FLOOR_MAX_DRIFT_KM. That
 *  hold only ever RAISES a position (`displayFloorHeightM` never lowers), so an
 *  under-read there is inert; here the held value IS the placement, so the error
 *  shows in both directions and the bound has to be tighter. */
const HELD_SNAP_MAX_DRIFT_M = 250;
/** @constant {number} How far a held measurement may disagree with FRESH
 *  measured evidence at the contact's current position before it is dropped
 *  rather than trusted.
 *
 *  The drift bound above asks "how far has the contact travelled?", which is a
 *  proxy for "does this value still describe the ground?" — and a proxy is all
 *  it is. 202 m of taxi onto a different surface is inside the bound and still
 *  wrong, and because a miss preserves the hold, repeated misses preserve the
 *  error for as long as they last. So the bound is not the only guard: where
 *  something has actually MEASURED the surface the contact is standing on now,
 *  that measurement outranks the memory, and a memory that contradicts it is
 *  discarded rather than stretched to cover the gap.
 *
 *  5 m sits between the two scales this has to separate:
 *   - ABOVE the honest disagreement between two measurements of the SAME
 *     surface. A floor cell is ~111 m across, so cell grade is ~0.6 m at the
 *     ~0.5 % KAUS spread this file's header cites and ~3.3 m even at a steep
 *     3 %; the hold's own 250 m allowance is ~1.3 m at that grade. None of
 *     those should cost a taxiing aircraft its model.
 *   - BELOW the scale at which a placement reads as wrong. The belly offsets
 *     this snap adds are ~2–5 m and an airliner fuselage is ~4 m across, so a
 *     model displaced more than ~5 m is visibly off its gear rather than
 *     imprecisely on it — and it is two orders under the ~100+ m burial the
 *     snap exists to prevent.
 *
 *  Applied in ONE direction: the hold is released only when fresh evidence sits
 *  ABOVE it, which is the BURIAL case — the model sunk into the surface, which
 *  is the entire reason this gate exists. The other sign is deliberately left
 *  alone, and the asymmetry is not tidiness:
 *
 *   - A cell reading LOW against a real sample is the EXPECTED error here, not a
 *     contradiction. Cells are a one-shot first-write latch over ~111 m, the
 *     borrowed-neighbour path leans to the LOWEST on purpose (`neighborFloorM`),
 *     and `displayFloorHeightM` only ever RAISES — the whole floor chain is
 *     built to under-read rather than to invent. Releasing on that sign would
 *     discard good measurements wherever the two disagree downward. Measured on
 *     the track-regression rig: a planted cell sat 66.7 m BELOW a real sample at
 *     the SAME spot, and a two-sided rule dropped a hold that was correct.
 *   - The residual is stated rather than hidden, and stated WITH its condition.
 *     A contact taxiing DOWNHILL keeps a held value above its new surface and
 *     its model floats. The correction is a SUCCESSFUL resample, and nothing on
 *     this path guarantees one: on the OSM fallback sampleHeight misses forever,
 *     so the retries never land and the float persists for as long as the
 *     contact stays inside HELD_SNAP_MAX_DRIFT_M. There is no timer beside it
 *     and no vertical cap of its own — only whatever the ground drops within
 *     that radius. The other releases (a ground flip via forget(), travelling
 *     past the bound, a mesh cell measuring ABOVE the hold) are not ones a
 *     downhill taxi is guaranteed to hit either. It is accepted over the
 *     alternative because it errs UPWARD and stays visible, where a buried model
 *     errs into the terrain and cannot be seen at all. */
