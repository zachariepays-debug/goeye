  //
  // The visible world in the google-3d regime is the PHOTOGRAMMETRIC MESH,
  // which sits above the Re:Earth bare-earth DEM (measured ~17 m at the Austin
  // airport apron) — so DEM-floored sprites/trails still buried themselves in
  // the mesh while 3D models (which groundSnap against the mesh) looked right.
  // This module samples the mesh height ONE-SHOT per coarse cell and reports it
  // to groundFloor.js, whose cachedGroundFloor() then answers mesh-first.
  //
  // Rationing (the CCTV loading-jitter lesson): scene.sampleHeight forces
  // tile-load prioritization at the probe point, so sampling is (a) gated to
  // cells NEAR the viewer — where tiles are streamed and where an error is
  // visible at all, (b) capped per call, (c) one-shot per cell for the session,
  // (d) skipped entirely outside the google-3d regime. A returned-undefined
  // probe (tiles not streamed yet) is NOT latched — it retries on a later call.
  //
  // Sample acceptance is sanity-gated against the DEM prior when warm (a
  // vertical probe can hit a rooftop or another aircraft instead of pavement):
  // the mesh legitimately sits ABOVE bare earth, so the window is asymmetric.
