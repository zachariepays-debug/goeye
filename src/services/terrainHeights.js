  //
  // Resolves ELLIPSOIDAL ground height per (lat, lon) via the server-side
  // `/api/terrain/heights` proxy (Task 2 — Re:Earth `heights.json`, disk-cached,
  // serve-stale). When the proxy is unreachable (or errors) AND the point isn't
  // already warm in this module's in-memory cache, falls back to bundled-geoid
  // math (Task 1, `src/data/geoid.js`):
  //
  //   sourceOrthometricM (if finite) + geoidHeight(lat, lon)  → source:'geoid-fallback'
  //   else geoidHeight(lat, lon) alone (H≈0 "at the geoid/coast" prior) → source:'geoid-fallback'
  //
  // Two things learned building the Task 2 proxy (see its report, and the
  // ledger's T2 entry) that this module builds in:
  //
  //   1. The proxy's GET has a Node http header-size ceiling — empirically a
  //      single request much past ~700-1500 points (depending on coordinate
  //      precision) risks a raw socket-level 431 *before* the proxy's own
  //      request handler runs. So every network request this module issues is
  //      chunked at CHUNK_SIZE (64 points), well under that ceiling, and
  //      chunks are sent SEQUENTIALLY (not in parallel) to keep this client
  //      well-behaved against a single dev-server proxy.
  //   2. The proxy's disk cache is keyed by the raw `points` query string, with
  //      no eviction — so a client that varies coordinate precision or point
  //      order defeats the warm cache and grows the cache file unbounded. This
  //      module rounds every coordinate to 5 decimal places (~1.1 m of
  //      precision at the equator — comfortably tighter than any of this app's
  //      placement needs) BOTH for its own in-memory cache key AND for the
  //      points string sent to the proxy, so repeated calls (including calls
  //      from a fresh page load, a different camera batch, etc.) consistently
  //      hit the same warm proxy cache entry.

  /** Max points per outgoing request to `/api/terrain/heights` (see file header, point 1). */
  // Match the server's upstream batch so sequential upstream work also fits
  // within this client's 30-second request deadline when Re:Earth slows.
