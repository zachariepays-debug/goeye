/**
 * Split-flap (departure-board) text animation for the status chips.
 *
 * When a chip's label changes — "LOADING LIVE DATA" → "LOAD COMPLETE",
 * "loading frames" → "camera grid ready" — the characters flip over
 * mechanically, left to right, like a Solari board at a ferry terminal.
 *
 * FOUR INVARIANTS HOLD THIS TOGETHER — do not "fix" any of them:
 *
 * 1. DOM TEXT IS THE TRUTH, AND ITS NODE NEVER MOVES. The first call upgrades
 *    a chip label into a permanent two-child shell: a `.gev-flap-text` span
 *    holding one long-lived `Text` node, and an `aria-hidden`
 *    `.gev-flap-cells` sibling. After that the ONLY text operation for the
 *    life of the chip is `node.data = next` — a single `characterData`
 *    mutation. Nothing is ever reparented, so the label is never
 *    transiently empty and the `aria-live` region never sees a removal /
 *    reinsertion pair it could announce twice. `element.textContent` is the
 *    settled string at every instant, because the cells carry NO text at all:
 *    both glyphs are CSS generated content (`::before` from `data-flap-prev`,
 *    `::after` from `data-flap-next`), which never reaches `textContent`.
 *    QA pins and the traffic chip's own `textContent !==` guard in ui.js
 *    therefore always read the truth; the flaps are purely visual.
 *
 * 2. NO ANIMATION LOOP, AND EXACTLY ONE TIMER PER CHANGE. The motion is CSS
 *    `animation`/`transition` only, triggered once per text change and
 *    staggered via a per-cell `--gev-flap-delay` custom property. A change
 *    schedules exactly ONE `setTimeout` — the settle that strips the cells.
 *    The width ease ends on a `transitionend`/`transitioncancel` listener,
 *    not a second timer. There is zero per-frame JS and zero periodic work;
 *    idle cost is nothing, and nothing here requests a Cesium render — the
 *    chips are DOM, outside the panel-stack observers, so the render governor
 *    is untouched.
 *
 * 3. ONLY WHAT WAS VISIBLE FLAPS AWAY. An interrupted cascade (A→B cut short
 *    by C) derives each column's outgoing glyph from what that column is
 *    actually SHOWING at that instant — which for a column whose stagger has
 *    not elapsed yet is still A, not the pending B. Deriving it from the
 *    pending target would flash a glyph that was never on screen.
 *
 * 4. COLUMNS NEVER RENUMBER MID-CASCADE. For the whole cascade the board keeps
 *    one column per index of the LONGER string, each holding its own width.
 *    A column the new string does not reach flaps its old glyph to a BLANK in
 *    place — exactly how a departure board clears a cell — rather than
 *    collapsing to zero width. Collapsing would stack the absolutely-positioned
 *    outgoing glyphs on top of each other and would let a later glyph slide
 *    into an earlier column, which in turn would make invariant 3 lie. The
 *    container only takes up the slack AFTER every flap has landed, as one
 *    smooth width ease.
 *
 * The motion vocabulary deliberately matches the cockpit odometer roll
 * (`setCockpitRollingValue`, style.css `.cockpit-roll-token`): ~200 ms per
 * character on `cubic-bezier(0.2, 0.75, 0.25, 1)`, reduced-motion collapsing
 * the duration rather than removing the animation. What this adds over the
 * odometer is the CASCADE — the left-to-right sweep that makes a departure
 * board read as a departure board.
